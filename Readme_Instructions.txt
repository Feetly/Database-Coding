	Welcome to Dhruv Programs
	
Here we intend to make a very self explainatory user friendly program for u guys to explore more:

Any crashes or Problems which might occur do to yr carelessness 
can be solved in following ways:
	1) Make Files with names : students.txt, instructors.txt, courses.txt repectively if doesnt exists.
	2) if file already exists, clear the contents of file nd add '0' in 1st line of all files nd without pressing enter, save nd cloe the file.
	3) or alternatively u can run the reset file using ./reset in terminal. 
	4) run the program using ./program or complite CS11.c file to get a executable file nd run it.
	5) make sure students.txt, instructors.txt, courses.txt are in the same directory of the executable file.
	6) never make changes directly to these sensitive files, as are easily vulnerable.
	7) Any Complains, Suggestions, Requests all can be mailed to 180020006@iitdh.ac.in.
	8) While adding data to programs, start from adding students than intructors nd then finally courses.
	9) Note while viewing all information, using a very strong linked tech., i filter all data nd i show all the usefull nd neccesary 			information.
	10) Make sure to always modify nd add changes to values of data which are defaulted by me so that yr data becomes more readable nd useful.
	11) Also delete nd modify useless data when required.
	*) Happy Programming.
	
Respect the Copyrights of program nd use these program carefully.
